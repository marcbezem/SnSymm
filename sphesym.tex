\begin{abstract}
  We first prove in HoTT-UF that
  \begin{displaymath}
    (\Sc = \Sc) \weq (\Sc + \Sc).
  \end{displaymath}
This result doesn't generalise to higher dimensions.
However, one can prove that $S^n = S^n$ is equivalent the sum of two
connected components, since the set truncation of $S^n = S^n$ is $\bool$. 
One component contains, of course, $\refl{S^n}$.
The other component contains ...
Moreover, these two components are equivalent.

\section{The circle}
In this document, we shall establish an equivalence
between the type of equalities of $\Sc$ with itself and the sum type
of $\Sc$ with itself. We work in intuitionistic Martin-LÃ¶f's type
theory with $\Sigma$-, $\Pi$- and $\mathrm{Id}$- types and with a
cumulative hierarchy of universes, simply written $\U$, for
which Voevodsky's univalence axiom hold. Moreover we introduce the
circle as a higher inductive type, meaning we postulate the existence
of a type $\Sc$ together with terms:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:1}
  \base &: \Sc\\
  \Sloop &: \base =_{\Sc} \base
\end{align}
This type enjoys a inductive property: given a type family
$T : \Sc \to \U$, an element $t:T(\base)$ and a path
$p:t=_{T(\base)}t$, the $\Sc$-induction property provides a dependent
function $f : \prod_{x:\Sc}T(x)$ such that $f(\base) \jdeq t$ and an
element $q: f(\Sloop) = p$. In particular, $\Sc$-induction provides a
map
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \left(\sum_{t:T(\base)} \pathover t T \Sloop t\right) \to \prod_{x:\Sc}T(x)
\end{equation}
that is easily shown to be an equivalence (through $\Sc$-induction
again). In the case $T$ is the family constant in $A:\U$, it gives the
following universal property of the circle:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \left(\sum_{t:A}t=t\right) \weq \left( \Sc \to A \right)
\end{equation}

Using univalence, one gets that $(\Sc = \Sc)$ is
equivalent to $(\Sc \weq \Sc)$ and we shall then concentrate on
proving
\begin{equation}
  (\Sc \weq \Sc) \weq (\Sc+\Sc)
\end{equation}
As usual, we shall denote $f:\Sc\weq\Sc$ for a map $f:\Sc\to \Sc $
such that the proposition $\isEq(f)$ is non-empty instead of the more
honest $(f,!):\Sc \weq \Sc$. 
This is harmless as the first projection is an equivalence
\begin{equation}
  ((f,!) =_{\Sc \weq \Sc} (g,!)) \simeq (f=_{\Sc \to \Sc}g).
\end{equation}

Recall that for each $x:\Sc$ one has an equivalence:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:8}
  f_x : (\base = \base) \to (x=x)
\end{equation}
Indeed, such a map $x\mapsto f_x$ is defined by $\Sc$-induction by
setting $f_{\base} \defequi \id$ and $f_{\Sloop}$ to be the proof that
postcomposing with the conjugation $\Sloop \blank \inv\Sloop$ is the
identity. In particular one can easily prove that
$f_x(\Sloop^k) = f_x(\Sloop)^k$ for any $k:\zet$. Now define $\iota_1$
and $\iota_2$ on each $x:\Sc$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
  \iota_1(x) (\base) &\defequi x & \iota_2(x) (\base) &\defequi x,
  \\
  \iota_1(x)(\Sloop) &\defis f_x(\Sloop) &  \iota_2(x)(\Sloop) &\defis f_x(\Sloop)^{-1}
\end{align*}
Each $\iota_j(x)$ ($j\in\{1,2\}$) is indeed an equivalence: $\Sc$
being connected, the proposition $\isEq(\iota_j(x))$ has to be proved
for only one point, say $\base$; but $\iota_1(\base)$ is equal to
$\id_\Sc$ (hence an equivalence) and $\iota_2(\base)$, that we call
$-\id_\Sc$ in the following, is its own pseudo inverse.

The maps $\iota_1$ and $\iota_2$ induce a maps
$\iota \defequi \langle\iota_1,\iota_2\rangle : \Sc + \Sc \to (\Sc\weq
\Sc)$.
\begin{theorem*}
  The map $\iota$ is an equivalence.
\end{theorem*}
%
Before proving the theorem, here is a lemma that already explains that
the two components of $\Sc+\Sc$ are mapped to distinct parts of
$(\Sc \weq \Sc)$.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:id-not-equal-oppid}%
  The type $(\id_\Sc = -\id_\Sc)$ is empty.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By function extensionality and $\Sc$-induction, an element
  $p : \id_\Sc = -\id_\Sc$ is given by the data of
  $p(\base) : \id_\Sc(\base) = -\id_\Sc(base)$, that is
  $p(\base):\base=\base$, together with a pathover
  $p(\Sloop): \pathover {p(\base)} {} \Sloop {p(\base)}$ in the type
  family $x\mapsto \id_\Sc (x)=-\id_\Sc (x)$. The transport over
  $\Sloop$ in this type family is given by
  $\inv\Sloop\blank\inv\Sloop$, so that $p(\Sloop)$ is equivalently
  given by an element of $\inv\Sloop p(\base) \inv\Sloop =
  p(\base)$. By expliciting $p(\base)$ as $\Sloop^k$ for some
  $k:\zet$, the last equation becomes
  $\inv \Sloop \Sloop^k \inv \Sloop = \Sloop^k$, leading to the
  contradiction $2=0$ in $\zet$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of the theorem]
  Take an element $\phi : \Sc \weq \Sc$ and consider the fiber of
  $\iota$ at $\phi$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fiber-iota-two-components}%
    \inv\iota(\phi) \jdeq \sum_{x:\Sc+\Sc} \phi = \iota(x)
    \weq \left(\sum_{x:\Sc}\phi = \iota_1(x)\right) +
    \left(\sum_{x:\Sc}\phi = \iota_2(x)\right)
  \end{equation}
  One wants to prove the proposition $\iscontr(\inv\iota(\phi))$,
  hence one may assume a path $q:\phi(\base) = \base$ instead of
  merely $\Trunc{\phi(\base) = \base}$. By the description of the
  symmetries of $\base:\Sc$, there is $k:\zet$ such that
  $q\phi(\Sloop)\inv q = \Sloop^k$. Denoting $\psi$ for a pseudo
  inverse of the equivalence $\phi$, one also gets
  $q':\psi(\base) = \base$ and subsequently $\ell:\zet$ such that
  $q'\psi(\Sloop)\inv{q'} = \Sloop^\ell$. Doing some path algebra it
  follows that:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:4}
    \psi(\phi(\Sloop)) = \inv{(q' \psi(q))}\Sloop^{\ell k} (q' \psi(q))
  \end{equation}
  By hypothesis, one has also $\tau : \prod_{x:\Sc}\psi\phi(x) = x$,
  so there is a pathover of type
  $\pathover {\tau(\base)} {} \Sloop {\tau(\base)}$ in the type family
  $x \mapsto \psi(\phi(x)) = x$. The transport over $\Sloop$ in this
  family is given by $\Sloop \blank \inv{(\psi\phi(\Sloop))}$, so that
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    \Sloop \tau(\base) \inv{(\psi\phi(\Sloop))} = \tau(\base)
  \end{equation}
  Putting equations~(\ref{eq:5}) and~(\ref{eq:4}) together, one find
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6}
    \inv{(q' \psi(q) \inv{\tau(\base)})} \Sloop^{\ell k} (q' \psi(q) \inv{\tau(\base)}) = \Sloop
  \end{equation}
  However, conjugation in $\base = \base$ is equal to the identity, so
  that in the end $\Sloop^{\ell k} = \Sloop$, or otherwise put
  $\ell k = 1$ in $\zet$. Using the decidability of equality on
  $\zet$, one can show that the only invertible elements of $\zet$ are
  $1$ and $-1$. So $k = 1$ or $k = -1$. We proceed by case:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $k=1$, then $Q \defequi (q, !)$ is element of
    $\phi = \id_\Sc$, where the term $!$ of the proposition
    $q=\Sloop q \inv{\phi(\Sloop)}$ is given by path algebra from the
    hypothesis $q\phi(\Sloop)\inv q=\Sloop^k$ ($k$ being $1$ here). We
    can then only show $\iscontr(\inv\iota(\id_\Sc))$ to conclude (by
    transport over $\inv Q$) that $\iscontr(\inv\iota(\phi))$. 

    One can immediately see that the second component of the right
    hand-side in equation~(\ref{eq:fiber-iota-two-components}) is
    empty when instantiated with $\id_\Sc$ for $\phi$: indeed,
    $\false$ being a proposition and $\Sc$ being connected, one only
    need to check that $\id_\Sc = \iota_2(\base)$ is contradictory;
    and because $\iota_2(\base) \jdeq -\id_\Sc$, it follows from
    lemma~\ref{lemma:id-not-equal-oppid}.

    Hence it remains to prove that $\sum_{x:\Sc}\id_\Sc=\iota_1(x)$ is
    contractible. For $x:\Sc$, the type $\id_\Sc = \iota_1(x)$ is
    equivalent (through first function extensionality and then
    $\Sc$-induction) to
    $\sum_{p:\base=\iota_1(x)(\base)}\pathover p T \Sloop p$ where $T$
    is the type family $y\mapsto y=\iota_1(x)(y)$. Now
    $\iota_1(x)(\base)\jdeq x$ and the transport over the loop
    $\Sloop$ in the type family $T$ is given by
    $\iota_1(x)(\Sloop) \blank \inv \Sloop$. In other words,
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:10}
      (\id_\Sc = \iota_1(x)) \weq \sum_{p:\base = x}f_x(\Sloop)p = p {\Sloop}
    \end{equation}
    By induction on $p:\base=x$, one can see that the proposition
    $f_x(\Sloop)p=p\Sloop$ is always satisfied. In the end, one has
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:11}
      \left(\sum_{x:\Sc}\id_\Sc=\iota_1(x)\right)
      \weq
      \left(\sum_{x:\Sc}\base=x\right)
    \end{equation}
    The type on the right is a singleton, hence contractible. This
    concludes the case $k=1$.
      \item The case $k=-1$ is completely similar to the case $k=1$. We
    now have a proof that $\phi = -\id_\Sc$, hence we shall prove that
    $\iscontr(\inv\iota(-\id_\Sc))$. From there one can determine that
    the first component of in (\ref{eq:fiber-iota-two-components}) is
    empty and concentrate on proving that
    $\sum_{x:\Sc}-\id_\Sc = \iota_2(x)$. The type
    $-\id_\Sc = \iota_2(x)$ is equivalent to
    $\sum_{p:\base = x}\inv{f_x(\Sloop)}p=p\inv\Sloop$ which is again
    equivalent to $\base=x$. We conclude the proof in the same way by
    recognizing a singleton.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{The sphere}
\newcommand{\Sp}{S^2}\newcommand{\mrd}{\mathit{merid}}
We define the sphere $\Sp$ as the suspension $\Sigma\Sc$ of the circle.
The suspension of a type $A$ is a higher inductive type 
with two point constructors and path constructors indexed by $A$:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:suspension}
  N &: \Sigma A \quad\text{the `North pole'}\\
  S &: \Sigma A \quad\text{the `South pole'}\\
  \mrd &: A \to (N =_{\Sigma A} S) \quad\text{the `meridians'}
\end{align}
Suspensions enjoy a inductive property: given a type family
$T : \Sigma A \to \U$, elements $n:T(N)$ and $s:T(S)$, and paths
$m(a) : n=_{\mrd(a)}s$ for all $a:A$, 
suspension induction provides a dependent
function $f : \prod_{x:\Sc}T(x)$ such that $f(N) \jdeq n$, $f(S) \jdeq s$,
and paths $p(a): f(\mrd(a)) = m(a)$ for all $a:A$.

Four equivalences $\Sp\to\Sp$ that will be used in the sequel are
defined as follows. 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:S2symmetries}
  e_0(x)&\jdeq x \quad\text{the identity equivalence}
\\\nonumber
\\\nonumber
  e_1(N)&\jdeq S \quad\text{flipping the poles}\\
  e_1(S)&\jdeq N\\
  e_1(\mrd(x))&= \mrd(x)^{-1}\quad\text{reversing the meridians}
\\\nonumber
\\\nonumber
  e_2(N)&\jdeq N \quad\text{keeping the poles}\\
  e_2(S)&\jdeq S\\
  e_2(\mrd(\base))&= \mrd(\base)^{-1}\\
  e_2(\mrd(\Sloop))&= \mrd(\Sloop)^{-1}\quad\text{reversing orientation of meridians}
\\\nonumber
\\\nonumber
  e_3(N)&\jdeq S \quad\text{flipping the poles}\\
  e_3(S)&\jdeq N\\
  e_3(\mrd(\base))&= \mrd(\base)^{-1}\quad\text{reversing the meridians, and}\\
  e_3(\mrd(\Sloop))&= \ap{\mrd(\_)^{-1}}(\Sloop)\quad\text{reversing their orientation}
\end{align}

One would expect $e_1=e_2$ and $e_0=e_3$.

\begin{proof}
We show $e_1(x)=e_2(x)$ for all $x:\Sp$ by suspension induction.
\end{proof}
